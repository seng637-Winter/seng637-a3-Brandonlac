# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we conducted coverage testing on the open-source Java framework for chart calculation, creation, and display, called JFreeChart. Within the JFreeChart, there were 2 classes of Range and DataUtility that were extensively tested in order to acheieve 90% line coverage, 70% branch coverage, and 60% branch coverage.


In this report, it will describe the process of testing and alterting of the testing suite that was used prior in lab 2 in order to achieve the coverage specified in the Lab. The report includes manual data-flow coverage calculations for two methods and outlines the testing strategy for new unit tests. It features a high-level overview of five test cases designed using coverage information to improve code coverage, accompanied by a brief coverage report presented visually. Additionally, it evaluates the pros and cons of the coverage tools used, compares requirements-based and coverage-based test generation, and reflects on team collaboration, workload distribution, encountered challenges, lessons learned, and provides feedback on the assignment itself.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

The testing strategy employed in this lab began with executing the test suite from Lab 2 and identifying coverage gaps relative to our targeted metrics, including method, statement, and branch coverage. Utilizing EclEmma for code coverage analysis, we visualized uncovered areas through color-coded highlights, facilitating the identification of deficiencies in coverage. To ensure efficiency and avoid redundancy, team members were assigned distinct methods, preventing any duplication of effort. Despite these initial efforts, gaps remained in meeting our specified metrics. This led us to a more detailed examination of specific methods and necessitated adjustments to our testing suite to ultimately fulfill our coverage objectives.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

### 1. DataUtility.calculateColumnTotal()
Before the addition of `calculateColumnTotal` tests, this method was untested. Our strategy for implementing comprehensive tests involved identifying scenarios to ensure all statements within the method could be executed and validated. Below are the specific cases we designed tests around:

Test Cases

**Subset of Valid Rows**
   - **Objective:** Verify the method correctly calculates the total using only the specified valid rows.
   - **Expectation:** The total matches the sum of values from the specified rows.

**No Valid Rows**
   - **Objective:** Test the method's behavior when no rows are considered valid.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns a total of 0.

**Null Data Input**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when provided with null data.
   - **Expectation:** An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

**Out of Bounds Row Indices**
   - **Objective:** Check how the method handles row indices that are outside the data structure's bounds.
   - **Expectation:** These rows are ignored, and the total calculation is unaffected.

**Null Values in Specified Rows**
   - **Objective:** Assess the method's capability to ignore null values in the computation of the total.
   - **Expectation:** null values are disregarded in the total calculation.


**Prior**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 50%      |
| Line      | 75%      |
| Method    | 100%      |


**After**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 87.5%      |
| Line      | 91.7%      |
| Method    | 100%      |

This resulted in majority of the branches being visited other than the code below from executing as there is means of total being > 0 when total is set to 0.0 prior. This line coverage also increased because of more lines being executed now in the test suite.
```
double total = 0.0;
if (total > 0){
            total = 100;
        }
```


### 2. **DataUtility.calculateRowTotal() with Valid Columns[]**
Before the addition of `calculateRowTotal` tests, this method was untested. Our strategy for implementing comprehensive tests involved identifying scenarios to ensure all statements within the method could be executed and validated. Below are the specific cases we designed tests around:


**Calculate Row Total with Valid Columns**
   - **Objective:** Verify that the method calculates the correct total for a row using only the specified valid column indices.
   - **Expectation:** The total accurately reflects the sum of values from the specified valid columns.

**Calculate Row Total with No Valid Columns**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the method returns 0.0 when an empty array of valid column indices is provided.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns a total of 0.

**Calculate Row Total with Invalid Column Indices**
   - **Objective:** Test the method's handling of invalid column indices (e.g., indices out of the range of existing columns).
   - **Expectation:** Invalid column indices are ignored, and they do not affect the total calculation.

**Calculate Row Total with Null Data**
   - **Objective:** Verify that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when the data provided is null.
   - **Expectation:** An IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

**Calculate Row Total with Some Null Values in Specified Columns**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the method correctly handles and skips null values in the specified valid columns.
   - **Expectation:** null values in specified columns are disregarded in the total calculation.

**Calculate Row Total with All Columns Valid**
   - **Objective:** Verify that the method calculates the total correctly when all column indices in a row are specified as valid.
   - **Expectation:** The total matches the sum of all values in the row, as all columns are considered valid.

**Prior**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 0%      |
| Line      | 0%      |
| Method    | 0%      |


**After**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 62.5%      |
| Line      | 91.7%      |
| Method    | 100%      |

This also resulted in an increase in the statement coverage, branch coverage for the if statements and as well full coverage for the method.

### 3. **Range default Constructor**
In the original test cases, there was a call to the default constructor in order to create the ranges' to be tested, however there was no test for when the lower number was higher than the upper number of the range.

Test Case 
**Give the default constructor a higher number for lower than the upper part of the range**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the method was tested for this a higher number in the lower part
   - **Expectation:** An IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

**Prior**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 50%      |
| Line      | 62.5%      |
| Method    | 100%      |


**After**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 100%      |
| Line      | 100%      |
| Method    | 100%      |

The resulting added new test case added to the amount of lines executed and added to the method coverage.

### 4. **Range.intersects()**
Before the addition of intersects tests, this method was untested. Our strategy for implementing comprehensive tests involved identifying scenarios to ensure all statements within the method could be executed and validated. Below are the specific cases we designed tests around:


**External Range Completely Precedes the Range Object**
   - **Objective:** Determine the behavior when an external range (`b0` to `b1`) is entirely before the Range object, with no overlap.
   - **Expectation:** There is no intersection between the external range and the Range object.

**External Range Overlaps Lower Bound of the Range Object**
   - **Objective:** Examine the case where the external range starts before and overlaps the lower boundary of the Range object.
   - **Expectation:** The external range intersects only at the lower boundary of the Range object.

**External Range Entirely Within the Range Object**
   - **Objective:** Verify the condition where an external range is completely encompassed within the Range object's bounds.
   - **Expectation:** The entire external range is contained within the Range object, indicating full overlap.

**External Range Extends Beyond Upper Bound of the Range Object**
   - **Objective:** Assess the scenario where the external range begins within the Range object but extends beyond its upper limit.
   - **Expectation:** The external range overlaps with the Range object and extends outside its upper boundary.

**External Range Completely Follows the Range Object**
   - **Objective:** Investigate the situation where the external range is entirely after the Range object, without any intersection.
   - **Expectation:** The external range does not intersect with the Range object at any point.

**External Range's Lower Bound Matches Range Object's Upper Bound**
   - **Objective:** Examine the behavior when the lower bound of the external range (`b0`) exactly matches the upper bound of the Range object.
   - **Expectation:** This specific alignment is identified, potentially as a boundary condition or a point of tangency without overlap.

**Prior**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | NA%      |
| Line      | 0%      |
| Method    | 0%      |


**After**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | NA%      |

The resulting new test increased the line coverage and the method coverage as the test suite initally did not cover this method.

### 5. **Range.combineIgnoringNaN()**
Before the addition of combineIgnoringNaN tests, this method was untested. Our strategy for implementing comprehensive tests involved identifying scenarios to ensure all statements within the method could be executed and validated. Below are the specific cases we designed tests around:


**Combine Ignoring NaN Two Null Ranges**
   - **Objective:** Verify the method correctly handles the case when both input ranges are null.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns null.

**Combine Ignoring NaN First Null Range**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the method correctly combines ranges when the first range is null and the second range is valid.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns the second range as the combined range.

**Combine Ignoring NaN Second Null Range**
   - **Objective:** Test the method's behavior when the first range is valid and the second range is null.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns the first range as the combined range.

**Combine Ignoring NaN With Valid Ranges**
   - **Objective:** Verify that the method calculates the total correctly when both ranges are valid.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns a range that accurately reflects the combination of both input ranges.

**Combine Null Ranges Ignoring NaN**
   - **Objective:** Assess the method's capability to handle a null input for the second range while the first range is valid.
   - **Expectation:** The method returns the first valid range as the combined range.

**Prior**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 0%      |
| Line      | 0%      |
| Method    | 0%      |


**After**
| Metric    | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch    | 64.3%      |
| Line      | 76.9%      |
| Method    | 100%      |

The resusls of the added test increased all three metrics that were being measured.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

## Requirements-based test generation

### Advantages

- Prioritizes testing the functionality that end-users will interact with, ensuring that the key features work as intended.
- Facilitates a direct link from functional requirements to specific tests, promoting accountability and traceability in the development process.

### Disadvantages

- May fail to identify incorrect behaviors not captured by the requirements, leading to potential oversights in testing.
- Functional requirements-based testing alone can result in poor code coverage, leaving many code branches and lines untested.

## Coverage-Based Test Generation

### Advantages

- Encourages thorough testing of the codebase, revealing uncallable functions and other issues that may not be immediately apparent.
- Provides clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of tests, ensuring that a wide range of code paths are evaluated.

### Disadvantages

- May neglect to assess whether the functions align with the original intent and purpose of the software.
- Achieving extensive code coverage can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring significant effort to develop and maintain.


# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

We got together to discuss the assignment and came up with the strategy to divide all of the methods into equal parts and then add the code into the central repo and then rerun the test. After the compliation of the code coverage, we then split into teams to tackle the deficiencies of the code coverage.



# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

A major difficutly that we ran into was getting the code coverage tools to run, some of the code coverage tools were outdated and have not been updated for a while. Leading to alot of issues with installation and getting them to work. A Challenge that we had to overcome as a team was filling in the deficiencies of the metrics. Some of the methods had for loops within them that would never run and we had to find ways to force the classes to take in invalid parameters that would be caught in the constructor. Lessons learnt in this lab would be that we should have familarize ourselves with the tools a bit more prior to getting together. This could have saved us alot of time.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

For this particular lab, we would recommand tailoring the tool to only Eclmma as it was the only tool that worked for us.
